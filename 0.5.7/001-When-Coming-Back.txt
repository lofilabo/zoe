1. Compile

1.1  IMMEDIATELY INSTALL:

	(You will, WILL see the following:
	....XXXX....YYYY.../GitHub/zoe/0.5.7/main.c:112:10: fatal error: readline/readline.h: No such file or directory
	  112 | #include <readline/readline.h>
		      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	)

	 sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev

     AND THEN we can install application!
     STEP 1.

	cmake .

     STEP 2.

	make

1.2 Final compile task - MOVE the compiled zoe to 

	/usr/local/bin/

	the command is:


      STEP 3. { 2 Possibilities!! }
	make install

	^^^^^^^^^^^MAYBE you have to run this as sudo:
		sudo make install

1.3 Delete an Unwanted File
	**You Will See A Fail Message**
	As follows:

	"CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory 
	/home/richard/(etc etc) join Strings together/CMakeCache.txt 
	is different than the directory /home/etc etc where CMakeCache.txt 
	was created. This may result in binaries being created in the 
	wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt"

	(this causes problems during Compiletion)

	DO NOT WORRY!
	DO NOT PANIC!

	Delete this file:

	CMakeCache.txt

	by doing: rm CMakeCache.txt

1.4 Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Are you trying to access a text file from another directory???
If you are executing ./zoe, and your program (maybe ./000-New/WW3-Web.zoe)
is in a 'lower' directory, MAKE SURE that there is a copy of the file
in ./zoe.

This problem will go away when your program is installed :)

2.1 Running

	Move Command Line to THIS directory, and execute:

	./zoe ./011.zoe 

	to 'prove' that you are in the right place.
