Seeing:

Segmentation fault (core dumped)

??

You are in the wrong directory!!

Move 'back' by one level, and execute the Thing from 'this'
directory from there !!

i.e.

being in This directory, and running:

	../zoe TTT-Database-SQL.zoe

will result in:

	"Segmentation fault (core dumped)"

so!!

cd ..   (move 'back one')

and execute:

	zoe ./000-New/TTT-Database-SQL.zoe

This should solve the problem.
