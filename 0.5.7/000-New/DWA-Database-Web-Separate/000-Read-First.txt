001. Intro

This is a *separate project* which contains ITS OWN
database, and COPY of the database-access programme.

This is done to help us work only on the Zoe aspect!
The C programming (for the database access) should be
separate from here ;)

What have is:

i.	EXECUTABLE to allow us to read/write from database.

ii.	DATABASE 'DRIVER'

iii.	DATABASE ONLY for this section.


i.e.

zdb_basement

zdb_data.db

zdb_output_data.txt

as usual, we can test like this:

	./zdb_basement "select * from testtable where id=1"

(and then change the SQL to test more and more)
