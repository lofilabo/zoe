my funny programming language

Welcome to zoe's home.

Current version: 0.5.7
(Season 5, Story 7, The Wheel in Space, Zoe's entry.)

Written in C.
Based upon LOLcode.

The reason that GNU is used here is....inheritace from 
LOLcode.  Given choice, MIT licence would have been used.
But this work is done due to the kindness of justinmeza 
(https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode) and we have right 
to even ask for changes.

Thank you very much, justinmeza.


The furpose of this programming language is to have....my very
own language to share.  It's a task I first attempted at age
13, using a BBC-B. Nuff said.

Hope you enjoy.
